(** {2 Requests}

    Requests are sent by a client, e.g. a web browser or cURL. *)

  (** A request with method, path, host, headers, and a body, sent by a client.

      The body is polymorphic because the request goes through
      several transformations. First it has no body, as only the request
      and headers are read; then it has a stream body; then the body might be
      entirely read as a string via {!read_body_full}.

      @since 0.6 The field [query] was added and contains the query parameters in ["?foo=bar,x=y"]
      @since 0.6 The field [path_components] is the part of the path that precedes [query] and is split on ["/"].
      @since 0.11 the type is a private alias
      @since 0.11 the field [start_time] was added

(** {2 Middlewares}

  type t = handler -> handler
  (** A middleware is a handler transformation.

      It takes the existing handler [h],
      and returns a new one which, given a query, modify it or log it
      before passing it to [h], or fail. It can also log or modify or drop
      the response. *)

    The server will not do anything until {!run} is called on it.
    Before starting the server, one can use {!add_path_handler} and
    {!set_top_handler} to specify how to handle incoming requests.

    @param masksigpipe if true, block the signal {!Sys.sigpipe} which otherwise
    tends to kill client threads when they try to write on broken sockets. Default: [true].

    @param buf_size size for buffers (since 0.11)

    @param middlewares see {!add_middleware} for more details.

    @param max_connections maximum number of simultaneous connections.
    @param num_thread number of thread to treat client.
    @param timeout connection is closed if the socket does not do read or
      write for the amount of second. Default: 0.0 which means no timeout.
      timeout is not recommended when using proxy.
    @param addr address (IPv4 or IPv6) to listen on. Default ["127.0.0.1"].
    @param port to listen on. Default [8080].
    @param sock an existing socket given to the server to listen on, e.g. by
      systemd on Linux (or launchd on macOS). If passed in, this socket will be
      used instead of the [addr] and [port]. If not passed in, those will be
      used. This parameter exists since 0.10.

    @param get_time_s obtain the current timestamp in seconds.
      This parameter exists since 0.11.

    calls [f "foo" 42 request] when a [request] with path "path/foo/42/"
    is received.

    Note that the handlers are called in the reverse order of their addition,
    so the last registered handler can override previously registered ones.

    @param meth if provided, only accept requests with the given method.
    Typically one could react to [`GET] or [`PUT].
    @param accept should return [Ok()] if the given request (before its body
    is read) should be accepted, [Error (code,message)] if it's to be rejected (e.g. because
    its content is too big, or for some permission error).
    See the {!http_of_dir} program for an example of how to use [accept] to
    filter uploads that are too large before the upload even starts.
    The default always returns [Ok()], i.e. it accepts all requests.
